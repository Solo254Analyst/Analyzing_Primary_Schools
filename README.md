# Python Project: Analysis of Primary Schools in Kibera, Kangemi and Mathare

The success of an organization lies in two things. First, the ability to define its goals and objectives. Secondly and more importantly, the capability to elaborately make sense of how to achieve the desired goals. The latter makes continuous improvement an integral function in any ambitious institution. From an education perspective, continuous improvement entails addressing all factors that affect the performance of learners. These factors are not just limited to the classroom. They include instructional solutions, student and parent engagement, school leadership, resource allocation, and even government policies. To identify school improvement needs in schools, one must compare the reality of things on the ground against how they should be. This project is a school improvement needs analysis for primary schools based in Kibera, Kangemi, and Mathare, three of the largest slum areas in Nairobi, Kenya.

## This Project

In this project, I obtained the data from [Open Schools Kenya](https://openschoolskenya.org/schools.json), an organization that collects data about schools in Nairobi Kenya, and shares it openly with the public. Using Python and Excel, I cleaned, analyzed, and visualized the data. This can be seen [here](https://nbviewer.org/github/Solo254Analyst/Analyzing_Primary_Schools/blob/main/Analysis%20of%20Primary%20Schools%20in%20Kibera%2C%20Kangemi%2C%20and%20Mathare%20.ipynb). I used the data to answer the following research questions:
1. What is the composition of primary schools in Kibera, Kangemi, and Mathare?
2. Is there a correlation between the student-teacher ratio and performance?
3. What is the availability status of key amenities - water, electricity, waste disposal, and toilets, in primary schools in Kibera, Kangemi, and Mathare?
4. What is the availability status of special programs - feeding, orphans, counseling, sanitary towels, special needs, and computer, in primary schools in Kibera, Kangemi, and Mathare?
5. What is the availability status of extracurricular activities - drama, music, sports, and scouts/girl guides, in primary schools in Kibera, Kangemi, and Mathare?

## My Findings
### 1. Most primary schools in Kibera, Kangemi, and Mathare are either private or government run schools

### 2. There is no any significant correlation between student-teacher ratio and performance

### Availability status of Key Amenities 
#### 3. Primary schools in Kibera, Kangemi, and Mathare are in need of water and waste-disposal programs. Only 47.7% and 10.9% reported having water and waste-disposal programs respectively

#### 4 The availability status of electircity and toilets is good (beyond 70%). However, the acceptable status for the four key amenities should be 100%.
